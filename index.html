            <p class="muted">We partner with communities to design local water solutions that last. Instead of temporary fixes, we focus on training, maintenance, and local ownership so clean water stays available for generations.</p>
            <p>Since 2010 we've helped fund hundreds of wells, trained local technicians, and supported hygiene programs that keep families healthy. Your donation goes directly to projects on the ground.</p>
